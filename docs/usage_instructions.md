## Django Admin Resume Editing

1. Create content in these Models listed on the lefthand side of the admin:

- Skills, Educations, Jobs (all linked to User)
- Bullets (linked to Job)

2. Create Resume and add previously created Skills, Educations, Jobs

3. To attach Bullets to a ResumeJob, edit ResumeJobs that were created in Step 2. (By editing already created ResumeJobs, the available Bullets will be filtered correctly. If adding a totally new Bullet from the popup window in this view, make sure to associate it with the current Job)
